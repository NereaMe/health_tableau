To help a medical staffing agency that
provides temporary workers to clinics

and hospitals on an as-needed basis, I
will help plan for the influenza season,
a time when additional staff are in
high demand.

The final results will examine trends in
influenza and how they can be used to
proactively plan for staffing needs
across the country.

**Research hypothesis:** If age is a significant factor in influenza mortality, then 65+ year individuals will have a higher risk of mortality compared to younger age groups. 
Confidence level of 95 % = There is strong evidence to suggest that the research hypothesis is true.
An **analysis of regional disparities** was conducted to understand the variations in influenza mortality rates across different regions.
_KEY INSIGHT_ - for instance, California has surprisingly low mortality rates despite its large elderly population. In contrast, Texas exhibits higher mortality rates despite having lower demographics.


**RECOMMENDATIONS**
Assess staffing adequacy in states with high incidence rates and
substantial elderly populations. 

Conduct surveys among healthcare personnel in California to
understand factors contributing to low mortality rates despite a
large elderly population.

Gather feedback from healthcare workers, patients, and the general
population to improve our knowledge and develop effective
preventive measures.
